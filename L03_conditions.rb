# 1. the String class method .include? returns true if the string contains sub-string or letter passed to the method
# write a loop which outputs months which do not begin with the letter "J"
puts "\n--------------------" # line to distinguish exercise output


# 2. write a game which displays a province name and asks for its code. if the user guesses wrong, end the game
# and display "Game Over.". if the user enter "quit", then display "Bye!" before displaying "Game Over."
# remember the built in method $stdin.gets.chomp gets user input and removes (chomps off) the training line return.
# there are different ways you could write this game. start wondering why one might be better than another.
