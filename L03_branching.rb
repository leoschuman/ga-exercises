# 1. Ask the user to input the number 1, 2, 3, or 4, then use "if" and related statements to display the months of 
# the corresponding quarter. If the user inputs an invalid value, let them know. Use ranges to retrieve sets of months.
puts "\n--------------------" # line to distinguish exercise output


# 2. Ask the user to input a degree value from 0 to 360. Assuming 0/360 is North, use "case" and "when" to output whether 
# the degrees point Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, or Northwest. Remember that $stdin.gets.chomp retrieves a string value.
