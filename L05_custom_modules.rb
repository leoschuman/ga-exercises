# 1. In the /lib directory, create a module named AppUtilities and save it as app_utilities.rb. 
# In your module, define two constants named HOME_IP and APP_NAME. Then define a utility method
# named sentence_cleaner for removing a specified word from a sentence. Write this method however
# you wish, or copy this simple example (only one of many ways you could do this).
#
#	def sentence_cleaner(sentence, bad_word)
#		word_array = sentence.split(' ')
#		new_sentence = ""
#		word_array.each do |word|
#			unless word == bad_word
#				new_sentence = new_sentence + word + " "
#			end
#		end
#		return new_sentence
#	end
#
# Once your app_utilities module is created, write the code needed below to load and use your module.
# Display both of your constants. Then, display the result of using your sentence_cleaner utility method.
